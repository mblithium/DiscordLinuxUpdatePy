# Discord Linux Update (Python)

A pretty stupid script to download and install Discord updates for non-ubuntu-based distributions, using the zipped (tar.gz) version available on the official website. 

Used by myself, it is necessary to _**run as root**_ due to the "opt" directory only allowing changes like this.

```
# Download and install updates
sudo python3 ./DiscordLinuxUpdate.py
```
